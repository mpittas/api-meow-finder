## About


Since I was young, I've loved cats a lot. I've always been curious about the different types of cat breeds, so I made an app that lets you explore and find out more about them. This app gets its information about cats from [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/).

If you find it useful please start the project on GitHub.
